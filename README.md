Uses the power of the **[WordPress REST API][wapi]** and **[Progressive Web Apps][pwa]** to form a portable app viewer for WordPress-based sites.

[Check it out in action][live]!

For a site to work, it has to meet the following criteria:

-   A **WordPress site** with the **WP-JSON API endpoint** visible.
    -   This is 'on' by default, but some security plugins suggest disabling it for 'security' reasons.
-   The API is **not** behind a **strict CORS policy**.
-   The WordPress site hasn't customised the default access policies.
    -   A typical custom config will be to require authentication for viewing endpoints, which this tool will not handle.
    -   The tool is built to handle these scenarios, but will degrade the experience.

> [!WARNING]  
> While we will [sanitise the HTML response](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify) from the source API, this tool will obtain and display HTML from the specified site. Please only **use this tool with websites you trust**!

## Getting Started

### With Gitpod

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/soup-bowl/pressify)

### Without Gitpod

This project requires NodeJS to develop, test and compile the code. The following will quickstart you.

```bash
npm ci
npm run serve
```

The API the system will communicate with is defined in the appropriate `.env`.

### Testing Offline Capabilities

If you want to test the PWA functionality locally, you can add the following to the `VitePWA()` segment in `vite.config.ts`:

```js
devOptions: { enabled: true },
```
